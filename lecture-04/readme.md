# Creation of a process -- the isolation between user space and kernel space

- A process is created when we **execute** a program. A program is a list of instructions compiled together to implement an algorithm or do some computation that we want to perform. Typicall, this program is launched via a shell.
- system calls are the interfaces provided by the operating system. These interfaces can be used to request the services of the operating system.
- A *system call* is a controlled entry point into the OS kernel, allowing a process to request that the kernel perform some action on the process's behalf.
- There is strict isolation between **processes** and the **kernel**. This is required to ensure safety and correctness of the computing system.
- The core concept behind this isolation is the **user space** and **kernel space** concept.
- This is supported by a special register in the processor. For example, the register CPL - if current privilege level is set to 0, the processor assumes that the kernel space tasks are being run. If CPL is 3 then user space tasks i.e. regular processes are running.
- The system calls are implemented in a way that this mode switch happens automatically when the system call is invoked. This is required because  when the user space process requests the operating system service via the system call, the control has to be switched to the kernel space task and then back to the user space.
- The  instruction on x86 that does is *int 0x80*.
- The system call invocation macro (implemented in the C library) executes a trap machine instruction. This is *int 0x80*. This causes the processor to switch from user mode to kernel mode (that is, it sets CPL=0) and executes the code pointed to by location *0x80* of the system's trap vector.
- The kernel invokes its *system_call* routine to handle the trap to location *0x80*. This is where the meat of the system call logic happens: the kernel does some bookkeeping, checks the validity of the arguments, invokes the service routine, and finally the service routine returns a result status to the *system_call* routine.
-  The wrapper function checks if the service returned an error, and if so, sets a global variable named *errno* with this error value. The wrapper function then returns to the caller and provides an integer return value to indicate success or failure.

# Understanding Processes

- Recall that process is a unit of execution. It is created when a program is executed. Multiple instance of same programs can be running simultaneously. Each instace is identified by using PID. Recall that you can use some of the current process in your linux installation using the ``top`` command.

## Anatomy of a process. 

![Process memory layout (32bit)](http://static.duartes.org/img/blogPosts/linuxFlexibleAddressSpaceLayout.png)

- The different sections of a processes' memory layout are:
   - Text Segement (lowest memory address). This contains the binary image or the instructions that are being executed.
   - Data segement. This contains all the global static variables that have been initialized, e.g. 
   
   ```
    #include <stdio.h>
	static char* message="Hello world"; //stored in data segement
	int main ()
	{
	  static int data=2; //stored in data segement 
	  printf("%s\n",message);
	}
   ```
   - BSS Segement (Block Started by Symbol) holds the uninitialized global variables. This segment was used to store global uninitialized variables in assembly code.
   - BSS also stores the uninitialized static local variables.
   ```
    #include <stdio.h>
	static char* message; //stored in BSS;
	int main ()
	{
	  static int data; //stored in BSS
	  printf("%s\n",message);
	}
   ```
   - HEAP : it is used for dynamic memory allocation. The process can request increase and decrease in the size of heap from the kernel. Some times a random offset between BSS and Heap is introduced so that a malicious code cannot guess the actual start address of heap.
     - HEAP is said to grow upwards (toward higher memory addresses).
   - Memory mapping segement : This is where all the dynamic libraries are loaded.
   - Stack:  The stack is a last in first out structure used to store automatic variables. It is also used to manage the control flow between subroutines. A special register called **stack pointer** holds the address of the top of the stack. This is adjusted when something new pushed on to the stack.
      - Note that stack grows down. That is it frows toward the 0 memory location. 
      - Stack is also used to track the return address for returning from the function.
      - Stack is also used to transfer function parameters during a function call.
   - You can use the ``size'' shell command on your executable to find out the size of each of these segments.
   - Top 1 GB of space of each process is reserved to hold the data for the kernel. This is done for efficiency. When a process makes a system call, the system call wrapper just points to a virtual address within the processes's address space. 
      - A process cannot alter the contents of the top 1 GB. This is prevented by the CPL register we discussed earlier.
   
   
   
# Direct Execution of program (Microcontroller)

- Load first instruction to program counter (PC)
- Execute
- Repeat (Loads next instruction into PC)
- What are the problems with direct execution:
- What if process wants to do something restricted ? 
- What if you have more than one process.

# The goal of the operating system is 	to run several processes concurrently.

- Each process thinks that it is the only one running on its own isolated machine (illusion)
- The CPU is time shared between the processes. In other words, the CPU resource is virtually shared .



# Running concurrent processes - limited direct execution 
- High level algorithm: Repeated at a high rate (linux typically runs this @250 Hz. This value is configurable. The parameter is called ``CONFIG_HZ``)
	- Load process
	- Run instruction
	- Save State <-- Important. Think why?
	-  Decide what to switch to (also called **context switch** - i.e. switch the context from one process to the other.) <-- Done by the kernel using the sceduler mechanism. We will discuss it later in the semester.
	-  Go to Load another process
		
		
# So what constitute the state of a process.
- Register : the current contents of the register. They have to archived if the process is going to resume execution from where it left.
- Program Counter: It points to the current instruction that is being run.
- Stack pointer: This is a special register that points to the top of the stack used by the process. Recall stack is used for controlling the order of the function execution as well as knowing where to return when a subroutine is called.
- Open File Descriptors
  - In Unix and related computer operating systems, a file descriptor (FD, less frequently fildes) is an abstract indicator (handle) used to access a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket.
  - Examples, from UNIX / Linux:
  
```
fd = open("out", 1);
write(fd, "hello\n", 6); /* fd is the file descriptor */
```
  -  There are three default file descriptors for each process - STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR
  - Refer to http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/stdout.3.html
- The current execution state of the process <-- important.

# The OS stores this state in a data structure (one per process). This data structure is called process control block. In Linux this data structure is named **task_struct**

# Switching between processes (context switch)
- What if the running process starts a slow procedure like interrupt?
- In principle there are two different kinds of techniques for deciding when to context switch.
	- co-operative: wait for the process to yield or issue syscall
	-  Non-cooperative â€“ set a periodic timer. When the timer interrupt comes, do not go back to the process that was executing before the interrupt arrives, but load another process. Also if the process makes a system call, the kernel can switch to another process when it finishes the execution of the service call.
-  General algorithm of context switch
	- It is implemented by the operating system scheduler. The scheduler maintains several queues. Each queue corresponds to one of the execution states a process can be in.
	- One of these queues is the ready queue. 
	- Let us assume that we only have one CPU. Then, one of the processes will be in the **runnning** state.
	- To context switch, the scheduler will change the state of the currently running process, put it into a different queue. Then, pick a different process (based on a scheduling policy - we will cover it later) and mark it running.
	

# Process Execution State

-  Ready, Running and BLOCKED
-  A process is marked waiting if it needs to interact with a peripheral, which is generally slower compared to the CPU.
-  When the peripheral sends an interrupt indicating that it is done, the OS can move the process from the waiting queue to the READY queue.
-  Then the OS can decide to run it at the next time there is a context switch.
	

# Overall Process Lifecycle

-  Creation - Reserve resources and set up data structures
-   Execution 
-   Termination - Release resources and clean up data structures.
